You can configure the plugin's behavior in the `config.json` file with the following options:

- **prefix**: Defines the prefix for the plugin's commands.
- **source_path**: Path of the folder to be compressed and uploaded.
- **dest_path**: Path where the downloaded backups will be stored.
- **firebase_config**: Key provided by Firebase App Storage, follow this [tutorial](https://github.com/judamar/QBTF/blob/main/tutorials/key_tuto.md).
